# PyBer_Analysis
##  Overview
---
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the data from CSV files to show case the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders. This will help to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability of underserved neighbourhoods.
---
## Results
* One striking conclusion that can be made from the analysis is that the average fare per ride in rural cities is higher than those in suburban and urban cites and this apparently this had an inverse relationship on the Total Rides in each city. They had the lowest number of rides for the period. 
* However even though the average fare by ride and average fare by driver in the urban cities was the lowest, they accounted for more than 70 % of the total fares.
* The total number of rides in the suburban cities was also far less than that in the urban cities.

## Summary
- A recommendation that I will make will be to increase the fares once a driver moves goes to a rural city to pick riders.
- There should be incentives given to drivers who drive in the rural cities to encourage more drivers to go to the rural cities.
